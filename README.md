Wii remote library to control things on the wii, example in the test folder, i'll make a file that shows every possible function soon enough.


You need the wiilua.dll/.so file and the wiiuse.dll/.so file in the same folder as the new_ffi script, i'll make a script to setup an environment with all those things soon, or maybe make it work with luarocks, i'll work on it i guess


to build the wiilua project, install xmake from https://xmake.io and then run xmake in the same directory, it should install any dependencies that might be missing, if there is any sort of error whatsoever please let me know by opening an issue
