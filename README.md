Wii remote library to control things on the wii, example in the test folder, i'll make a file that shows every possible function soon enough.


You need the wiilua.dll/.so file and the wiiuse.dll/.so file in the same folder as the new_ffi script, i'll make a script to setup an environment with all those things soon, or maybe make it work with luarocks, i'll work on it i guess
